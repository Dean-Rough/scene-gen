# AI Agent Tasks

This file tracks tasks for AI agents using git worktrees and tmux sessions.

## Phase 1: Complete ✅
**Status**: All core functionality implemented and deployed
- ✅ Database schema with PostgreSQL (projects, assets, scene_elements)
- ✅ Complete CRUD API endpoints for projects and assets  
- ✅ Interactive canvas component for asset placement
- ✅ Asset library with upload functionality
- ✅ Frontend-backend integration with working proxy
- ✅ Neon DB connected and tested
- ✅ Production build ready for Vercel deployment

## Phase 2: Enhancement & Scaling Tasks

### Task 1: Real Gemini AI Integration
- **Branch**: feature/gemini-integration
- **Status**: pending
- **Description**: Replace the simulated render endpoint with real Gemini 2.5 Flash Image API integration. Implement the Prompt Orchestration Engine that constructs multimodal prompts combining floorplan images, asset placements, materials, and render settings. Handle image uploads to cloud storage and integrate with Gemini API for actual AI rendering.

### Task 2: Advanced Canvas with React-Konva
- **Branch**: feature/advanced-canvas
- **Status**: pending
- **Description**: Upgrade the simplified HTML canvas to a full React-Konva implementation with drag-and-drop, rotation, scaling, and layer management. Add asset transformation controls, snap-to-grid functionality, and proper collision detection for a professional design experience.

### Task 3: Cloud Asset Storage System
- **Branch**: feature/cloud-storage
- **Status**: pending
- **Description**: Implement cloud storage integration (AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage) for uploaded assets. Replace local blob URLs with permanent cloud URLs, add image optimization, thumbnail generation, and CDN integration for better performance and scalability.

### Task 4: User Authentication & Multi-tenancy
- **Branch**: feature/auth-system
- **Status**: pending
- **Description**: Integrate user authentication using the provided Stack Auth keys. Implement user-specific project isolation, sharing capabilities, and role-based permissions. Add user profiles, project collaboration features, and secure API endpoints.

### Task 5: Advanced Rendering Features
- **Branch**: feature/advanced-rendering
- **Status**: pending
- **Description**: Implement advanced rendering options including lighting controls, camera positioning, material specifications, and style presets. Add render history, batch processing, and high-resolution export capabilities with progress tracking.

### Task 6: Performance Optimization
- **Branch**: feature/performance
- **Status**: pending
- **Description**: Optimize application performance with React.memo, virtualization for large asset libraries, lazy loading, bundle splitting, and database query optimization. Implement caching strategies and background processing for renders.

### Task 7: Mobile Responsive Design
- **Branch**: feature/mobile-responsive
- **Status**: pending
- **Description**: Create responsive design for mobile and tablet devices. Implement touch-friendly canvas interactions, mobile-optimized asset library, and adaptive UI components that work across all screen sizes.

### Task 8: Vercel Deployment & CI/CD
- **Branch**: feature/deployment
- **Status**: pending
- **Description**: Set up automated Vercel deployment with proper environment variable management, preview deployments for pull requests, and CI/CD pipeline with automated testing. Configure custom domain and SSL certificates.
